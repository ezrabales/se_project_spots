### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- tech and techniques

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Tech and Techniques**

I used many css styles, including block displays for the cards, and flex displays most of the other showcased layouts. I used media quieries along with block displays to make the page dynamic based on screen width. Lastly I had everything neetly organized using the BEM methodology for files and class names.

Here are some links to some images that showcase the dynamic layout of the design:
